## Memories with Scott Horn

1) The time I made him blow our entire annual engineering budget on one happy hour
2) The time I made him wait an hour for Chinese food and we talked about product philosophies
3) The time I trapped him in a small karaoke room with a bunch of screaming Lshoppers and then made him foot the bill for his own ears bleeding

## What I Will Miss About Scott

2) All of the times that he gave me a chance to prove that the above was the case
